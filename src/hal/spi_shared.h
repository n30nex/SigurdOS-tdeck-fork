/**
 * Shared SPI2_HOST (FSPI) bus singleton.
 *
 * The T-Deck's SPI bus (SCK=40, MOSI=41, MISO=38) is shared by three
 * peripherals: display (ST7789 via LovyanGFX), LoRa (SX1262 via RadioLib),
 * and microSD card. LovyanGFX manages its own bus internally using the IDF
 * SPI driver directly. The LoRa radio and SD card each used separate Arduino
 * SPIClass instances on the same host, causing double bus initialisation.
 *
 * This singleton provides a single SPIClass(FSPI) instance that both the
 * LoRa radio and SD card should use, ensuring the bus is initialised once
 * and all transactions share the same bus lock.
 *
 * NOTE: Do not #include <SPI.h> in this header — it breaks native test builds.
 * SPIClass is available through Arduino.h (real or mock) which every file
 * that includes this header already pulls in.
