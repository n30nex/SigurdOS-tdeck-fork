# Network Screen (Finder)

The Network screen (internally called **Finder**) is SigurdOS's node discovery and network neighbourhood view. It displays nearby nodes discovered via MeshCore adverts, sorted by most recently seen, and includes a **Ping Nearby** feature to actively probe for reachable nodes on the mesh.

## Ping Nearby System

The Ping Nearby feature actively discovers which nodes are within immediate LoRa range using a lightweight zero-hop request/response protocol.

### Protocol

```
Initiator                    Responder(s)
    │                            │
    │  ── PING:<tag> ──────────> │  (sendZeroHop, control-disco bit set)
    │                            │
    │  <── PONG:<tag>:<name>:<rssi> ──  │  (sendZeroHop, control-disco bit set)
    │  <── PONG:<tag>:<name>:<rssi> ──  │  (each reachable node responds)
    │  <── ...                        │
    │                            │
    │  ── collection window ──── │  3 seconds (PING_WINDOW_MS)
```

**Tag matching:** Each ping generates a unique tag (`now ^ (intptr_t)this`) to prevent stale or cross-session PONGs from being accepted. The tag is formatted as an 8-digit hex string and embedded in both the PING and PONG payloads.

### Key Constants (from `sigurd_mesh_v2.h`)

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `PING_WINDOW_MS` | `3000` | Collection window duration in milliseconds after sending a PING |
| `PING_COOLDOWN_MS` | `30000` | Cooldown period in milliseconds (30 seconds) between successive pings |
| `PING_RESULTS_MAX` | `32` | Maximum number of unique PONG responses stored per ping |

### Wire Format

| Message | Format | Sent via |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **PING** | `"PING:%08lx"` (e.g. `PING:A3F72C81`) | `sendZeroHop()` with control-disco bit set |
| **PONG** | `"PONG:<tag>:<name>:<rssi>"` (e.g. `PONG:A3F72C81:NodeAlpha:-72`) | `sendZeroHop()` with control-disco bit set |

Both messages use `createRawData()` and set `payload[0] |= 0x80` to mark them as control-disco packets. This ensures they are handled by `onControlDataRecv()` and **not** forwarded beyond the immediate one-hop neighbourhood.

### PingResult Struct

```cpp
struct PingResult {
    char name[32];   // Node's self-reported name (max 31 chars + NUL)
    int  rssi;       // RSSI of the PONG response (dBm)
};
```

Returned by `getPingResult(i)` for `i` in `[0, getPingResultCount())`.

## Screen Behaviour

### Ping Button (Ready State)

When `pingIsActive()` is false and `pingOnCooldown()` is false, the top area shows a styled **"Ping Nearby"** button (`ACCENT` cyan, 100×22px, zero-radius). Tapping it:

1. Calls `sigurdos::mesh::sendPingNearby()` — sends the PING with a unique tag
2. Recreates the screen via `finder_screen_show()` — transitions to listening state

### Listening / Active State

When `pingIsActive()` returns true (a ping was sent within the last 3 seconds), the button area shows:

> 🔊 **Listening... (1/3)**

The elapsed seconds update when the screen is recreated (the screen does not poll — the countdown is a snapshot). The three-second collection window accepts PONG replies from any node whose tag matches.

### Cooldown State

After the collection window expires, the device enters a **30-second cooldown**. The status line reads:

> 📶 **Ping ready in 27s**

The countdown decrements in seconds. The Ping Nearby button is hidden until the cooldown completes and `pingOnCooldown()` returns false.

### Node List Display

The content area below the ping row is populated from one of two sources:

#### 1. Ping Results Available (`getPingResultCount() > 0`)

If the most recent ping produced results, the list shows nodes **in arrival order** (first respondent at top):

```
◎ NodeAlpha  -72dBm
◎ NodeBeta   -88dBm
◎ NodeGamma  -91dBm
```

Each row:
- Prefixed with `LV_SYMBOL_WIFI` (Wi-Fi icon)
- Shows name and RSSI (e.g. `NodeAlpha  -72dBm`)
- Alternating row colours (`BG_TERTIARY` / `BG_INPUT`)
- A footer at the bottom reads: `✓ 3 nodes responded`

#### 2. No Ping Results — Fallback to Recent Contacts

If no ping has been run yet or no results were received, the screen falls back to displaying recently seen nodes from the contact database (`exportContactsFull`):

| Filter | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Time window | Contacts seen within the last **120 seconds** |
| Sort order | Most recently seen first (descending `last_seen`) |
| Row format | `◎ NodeName  45s ago  -91dBm` |
| Exclusion | Nodes older than 120 seconds are hidden |

#### 3. Empty State

If no ping results exist, no recent contacts are available, and the device is not on cooldown, a single row reads:

> 🔊 **Listening...**

This signals that the radio is active and awaiting incoming adverts or a manual ping activation.

## Implementation Details

### `finder_screen_show()` (`src/ui/screens/screen_finder.cpp`)

1. Calls `make_screen_full("Finder")` to construct standard chrome.
2. Checks `getPingResultCount()` to decide between ping mode and fallback mode.
3. Builds a **ping row** (24px tall, flex row) at `CONTENT_Y + 2`:
   - **Active**: Shows `LV_SYMBOL_AUDIO` + "Listening... (elapsed/total)" in `ACCENT`
   - **Cooldown**: Shows `LV_SYMBOL_WIFI` + "Ping ready in Ns" in `TEXT_SECONDARY`
   - **Ready**: Shows an `ACCENT`-coloured button labelled "Ping Nearby"
4. Creates an `lv_list` for the node results below the ping row (`CONTENT_H - 44` tall).
5. Populates the list:
   - Ping results: iterates `getPingResult(i)` for each responder
   - Fallback contacts: bubble-sorts by `last_seen` descending, filters to ≤120s old
   - Empty: adds a single "Listening..." placeholder
6. Calls `show_screen(scr)` with slide-in animation.

### Message Handling (`onControlDataRecv` in `sigurd_mesh_v2.h`)

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **PING received** | Extracts tag from payload. Builds `PONG:<tag>:<own_name>:<rssi>`. Sends zero-hop reply. |
| **PONG received** | Verifies `_ping_sent_at != 0` and `_ping_tag != 0`. Checks collection window hasn't expired (`now_ms < _ping_sent_at + PING_WINDOW_MS`). Extracts and compares tag. Parses name and RSSI. Stores in `_ping_results[]` up to `PING_RESULTS_MAX`. |

### Re-entrancy

The ping button's event handler calls `finder_screen_show()` again to rebuild the UI in the active state. This means the screen is **re-entrant** — it fully tears down and rebuilds on each state transition.

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| **Multiple pings back-to-back** | Blocked by 30s cooldown. `sendPingNearby()` returns `false` if `now - _ping_last_at < 30000`. |
| **Stale PONG after window** | Rejected — if `now_ms > _ping_sent_at + PING_WINDOW_MS`, the PONG is silently dropped. |
| **PONG with wrong tag** | Rejected — tag comparison fails, the PONG is dropped. This prevents cross-session contamination. |
| **32+ responders** | Only the first 32 are recorded (`PING_RESULTS_MAX`). Later PONGs are silently dropped. |
| **Duplicate PONGs** | Not explicitly deduplicated — the same node sending multiple replies creates duplicate entries. |
| **Node renames before ponging** | The `onControlDataRecv` handler reads the name directly from the PONG payload (`remaining` → `rssi_start`), so the name is self-reported at response time. |
| **Self-ping prevention** | Handled by the mesh stack — `sendZeroHop` does not echo back to the sender. |

## Related Screens

| Screen | Relationship |
|--------|-------------|
| **Signal** ([SIGNAL_SCREEN](SIGNAL_SCREEN.md)) | Radio stats (RSSI, SNR, noise) — same radio hardware |
| **Contacts** (`contacts_screen_show`) | Full contact list (alphabetical, all ages) — tapped to DM |
| **Packets** (`heard_screen_show`) | Raw packet log with per-packet RSSI/SNR — useful alongside ping diagnostics |
| **Advertise** (`advertise_screen_show`) | Manual advert broadcast to announce presence on the mesh |

## Audio / Visual Indicators

| State | Visual |
|-------|--------|
| Ping ready | Accent button `[Ping Nearby]` |
| Listening | `🔊 Listening... (1/3)` in accent |
| Cooldown | `📶 Ping ready in 27s` in secondary text |
| Results footer | `✓ 3 nodes responded` in secondary text, bottom-aligned |
| No activity | `🔊 Listening...` placeholder in the list |
